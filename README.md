## Social music video streaming ##
Share and discover new music videos with your friends in real time via music video stations hosted by people like you!

## Summary ##
MuseVid.io aims to make it easy to share music videos with friends in real time regardless of distance. This is achieved by integrating YouTube's vast database of music videos with a real time messaging app. As a result you can chat with your friends, and watch along with them in real time. Some fun benefits to using this are: you can essentially create your own (classic) MTV style radio station for people to listen to, you can talk about a song with people as it's happening, or you can have people help you discover new music.

## Problem ##
It can be difficult to discover new music and you may be missing out on songs you would never think to listen to.

## Solution ##
This app makes it fun and easy to find and share new music videos with friends or discover new music videos from people around the world.
